# Whirlviz

Whirlviz is a web-based visualization tool that generates dynamic, swirling, and flowing patterns inspired by oscilloscope art. It's designed for musicians, VJs, and creative coders who want to explore the intersection of sound and visual art within the browser.

## Current Status

Development is still at a very early stage and not all of the features listed below have necessarily been implemented yet.

## Features

* **Oscilloscope-Inspired Visuals:** Create mesmerizing, swirling patterns driven by audio signals or other data sources.
* **Real-time Visualization:** Experience dynamic and interactive visualizations that react to live audio or data.
* **Customizable Parameters:** Tweak various parameters to control the shape, color, and movement of the visualizations.
* **Web-Based Platform:** Run Whirlviz directly in your web browser without any installations.
* **Creative Coding Playground:** Experiment with different algorithms and techniques to create unique visual effects.

## Getting Started

The project is still at a very early stage of its development, the instructions may not be up to date and properly tested.

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/esqilin/whirlviz`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd whirlviz`
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4.  Run the development server: `npm run start` or `yarn run start`
5.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:9773`

## USAGE

You can connect any MIDI device supported by your operating system.
The computer keyboard can be used too, but at this time, only the German layout is supported:
